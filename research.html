	      Abstract<br />
              In order to perform autonomous sequential manipulation tasks, perception in cluttered scenes remains a critical challenge for robots. For this problem there was a previous research project that proposed a probabilistic approach for robust sequential scene estimation and manipulation - Sequential Scene Understanding and Manipulation (SUM). SUM considers uncertainty due to discriminative object detection and recognition in the generative estimation of the most likely object poses maintained over time to achieve a robust estimation of the scene under heavy occlusions and unstructured environment. 
	     <p dir="ltr">However a new problem arose, this problem was with processing of the scene and the tracking the objects. This new problem comes from congestion information when processing the scene. Therefore, a method for reducing this congestion in processing came in the form of a cluster. The cluster is built from the desktops and a laptop (nodes) that were already in use within the lab. The laptop and all of desktops all run a Linux based operating system, near field communication (nfc) to share the files, OpenMPI to send messages between all of the nodes, and ganglia to monitor the cluster. 
	     <p dir="ltr">The team compared the results of a test code that ran on different number nodes of the cluster. These results showed that as the more and more nodes were added, the time to render actually did come down. It also showed that since some of the machines were more powerful than others that it would be also more useful to put multiple graphics cards on a single machine.

              Abstract<strong><br />
              </strong>                        According to the State Climate Office of 		North Carolina, since 2007 the northern coastal plain of 		North Carolina has been experiencing a long-term 		summer drought. The team’s objective was to analyze 		how long-term drought in summer months’ affected 		vegetation and land surface temperature in the 		Pasquotank, Perquimans, Camden and Gates county 		areas. The team collected imagery data through the 		SeaSpace TeraScan system in order to produce land 		surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference 		vegetation index (NDVI) products. The data products 		were averaged into monthly and yearly composites so 		that the team could use TeraVision to depict the 		differences of values for the products.

              Abstract<br />
              The Pasquotank River Watershed is found in Northeast North Carolina beginning in the Great Dismal Swamp at the Virginia/North Carolina border and flows into the Albemarle Sound. The watershed provides a transition between the Great Dismal Swamp and the waters of the Albemarle Sound. The watershed is surrounded by a variety of landforms including swamps, farmland, and suburban developments. These produce a variety of runoff into the watershed affecting both the aquatic vegetation and marine life in the waters. This project built on the previous analysis of the four tributaries and the Pasquotank River completed in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015.            
            <p dir="ltr">The 2016 Research Experience for Undergraduates Pasquotank River Watershed Team completed one set of tests of the watershed. These test points originated from the 2011 and 2013 research projects with the addition of four points created in 2014 to sample further downstream in the Pasquotank River. The results were compared with previous readings utilizing a Water Quality Index (WQI), a unitless number ranging from 1 to 100 with higher numbers denoting better water quality. The waterways tested were the Pasquotank River, Newbegun Creek, Knobbs Creek, Areneuse Creek, Mill Dam Creek, and Sawyers Creek. These creeks, along with the Pasquotank River, cover a large portion of the watershed and provided a wide area of study for the watershed.</p>
              <p dir="ltr">Tests performed in the laboratory on this year&rsquo;s samples include pH, salinity, total dissolved solids, and conductivity. Air/water temperature, dissolved oxygen, wind speed/direction, and turbidity/clarity measurements were taken in the field. The results collected were placed online and displayed in correlation to their position utilizing Google Maps. The data was then be compared to the previous projects results.</p>
                The overall water quality index (WQI) for all of the tested waterways combined remained on a constant pattern. However, results of this project may have varied due to several changes. A new dissolved oxygen meter was utilized and the method for calibrating the meter was changed. A different WQI calculator was also used as the previously used calculator was a Windows operating system application. All of the waterways, except for Sawyers Creek, were at their lowest WQI when being compared to past research ranging from 2011 to 2015. This may have been due to the high temperature readings during 2016. Turbidity, total dissolved solids, and dissolved oxygen were considerably different from previous years. The water testing for the five years of tests are displayed in Appendix 1. The Lower Pasquotank still has the best water quality index, but the waterway had a significant decrease in its water quality score. &nbsp;When compared to the results of the 2014 team and the 2015 team, the Lower Pasquotank water quality went from having a ranking of a good water quality score to dropping 21 points, giving it a ranking of a medium water quality score. NewBegun Creek, Areneuse Creek, Mill Dam Creek, Sawyers Creek, Knobbs Creek, and Pasquotank River all had a ranking of a bad water quality index score this year, which ranges from 25 to 50. Areneuse Creek was the worst waterway tested during this research. &nbsp;Mill Dam Creek, Areneuse Creek, and NewBegun Creek obtained the worst water quality index score out of all of the past research. Sawyers Creek and Knobbs Creek are close in readings because they are similar in size and very close to each other.

              Abstract<br />
              During the 2016 Spring Semester, the Research Experience Undergraduates  Networking team project identified, evaluated, and implemented a video  conference solution. The main objective was to establish a fully  functioning video conferencing solution in four locations:  Dixon-Patterson Hall, Rooms 226, 232 and Lane Hall, Rooms 111 and 119. To understand and create the scope of work for the project, the team had  to research/analyze the rigorous standards which are set in place by  the International Telecommunications Union. This agency works directly  under the authority of the United Nations and is charged with issues  relating to information and communication technologies. The team  examined the H.323 standard for Telemedicine, how Telemedicine has  evolved, and how the H.323 standard has progressively changed the way we  conduct our lives. After replicating the layout of the four spaces, the next objective was  to identify and evaluate a software solution. After identifying and  evaluating multiple video conferencing applications, the team selected a  specific application.  An example of an issue which eliminated one  application was when an application indicated that a user would only  have to open a link in the browser to be able to connect; but it did not  indicate that the link would only work from within a certain browser.  As for the hardware, the technical specifications of components were  used to identify the hardware components. This method of selection,  immediately gave preference to specific devices. The team also analyzed the history of video conferencing and how it has  evolved. This research project enables the Center of Excellence in Remote Sensing  Education and Research (CERSER) participants and invited guests to  engage with others through video conferencing services.
